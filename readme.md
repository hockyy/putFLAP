# PUTflap
PUTflap is an extension of JFLAP, which makes JFLAP features available from the command line and can report results as JSON

## features
The aim of this project is to support full JFLAP functionality from command line. Currently only some part of it is available.

Every operation provides its results as JSON file. Optionally if the result can be written as JFLAP file it can output such file.

### current support
#### Finite State Automaton
- generation of random, deterministic FSA
- generation of random valid word
- run FSA for given input
- test for nondeterminism
- test for lambda transitions
- test of equivalence of two FSAs
- retrieve alphabet
- conversion to deterministic FSA
- conversion to minimal FSA
- conversion to grammar
- conversion to regular expression

#### Mealy and Moore Machine
- generation of random, deterministic machine
- generation of random valid word
- run machine for given input
- test for nondeterminism
- test for lambda transitions
- retrieve input and output alphabet

#### Pushdown Automaton
- generation of random, deterministic PDA
- generation of random valid word
- run PDA for given input
- test for nondeterminism
- test for lambda transitions
- retrieve alphabet
- conversion to grammar

#### grammar
- generation of random regular grammar
- retrieve alphabet
- conversion of regular grammar to FSA

## usage
Gradle tasks implemented in project generate three equally capable version of PUTflap: **jar**, **Linux zip** and **Windows exe**.

### build and run
#### jar
**build:** `./gradlew clean build shadowJar` build result is saved in `build/libs`

 **run:** `java -jar putflap.jar ARGS`

#### Linux 
**build:** `./gradlew clean build shadowJar` build result is saved in `build/distributions`

**run:** `./putflap ARGS`

#### Windows
**build:** `gradlew.exe clean build shadowJar createExe` build result is saved in `build/exe`

**run:** `putflap.exe ARGS`
